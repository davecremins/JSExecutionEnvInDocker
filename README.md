The challenge

`breadCrumbMaker.js` is a JavaScript solution to [this](https://www.codewars.com/kata/563fbac924106b8bf7000046) codewars problem.

When running the tests for the solution I would sometimes receive a message relating to an error with the running container. For the purposes of a challenge I decided to see if I could create a simple JS execution environment in a Docker container and specify which function & args to run.
